# Idea
In this game, you fight with swords and basic pistols, with the best ranged weapon being a light revolver that has six shots. The main gameplay focuses on sword fighting. Although this is not a serious project yet, it serves as a way for me to challenge and improve my skills. All the art used is inspirational and credited with links to the original sources. This site serves as an organizing place and presentation page, so please do not be upset with me for using the art.
## Gameplay
- Abilities that represent stances
- Attack, parry (you can also parry bullets - includes a screen effect when you are targeted) and limited range attacks
- Skills (with no cooldowns individually, just a global cooldown for all. This cooldown also dictates the speed of the animations)
- Each stance has:
    - A specific attack speeds that will decide the global cd, the attack speed and the parry speed
    - Types of attack: Slice and stab
    - 3 attacks. Each of them has steps. On each steps execute a distance and an arria of attack. As well as a type of attack (for example once stance would attack 1 square in front with the attack speed)
    - A passive for that character
    - An additional passive for each stance
    - Depending on the stance you can move slower, normal or not at all while hiting
    - Dodge (same for all characters, the cd is set by attack speed)
