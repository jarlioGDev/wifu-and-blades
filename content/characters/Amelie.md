description: 'Amelie is a valiant paladin with flowing blonde hair, clad in the resplendent colors of blue and white. Her striking armor is adorned with a robust shield, featuring a blue cross with crests, while she wields a slim but sturdy sword. The tale goes that Rose came into being through the collective desire of the European people to protect the exquisite beauty of their creations.'

# Amelie (Shield and Sword - Paladin)
European girl inspired by juan d arc. Has one hand sword and one shield, changing stances between defensive and offensive in each she hit with her shield. On the long run I planed that she would be more a support character, but at the same time we want to be as playable solo as possible.

- **Good parry ability** Unlimited parry speed when shield in hand
